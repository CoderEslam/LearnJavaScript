  Apple is the common name for any tree of the genus Malus, of
  the family Rosaceae. Apple trees grow in any of the temperate
  areas of the world. Some apple blossoms are white, but most
  have stripes or tints of rose. Some apple blossoms are bright
  red. Apples have a firm and fleshy structure that grows from
  the blossom. The colors of apples range from green to very
  dark red. The wood of apple trees is fine grained and hard.
  It is, therefore, good for furniture construction. Apple trees
  have been grown for many centuries. They are propagated by
  grafting because they do not reproduce themselves.
